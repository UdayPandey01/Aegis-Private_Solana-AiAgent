Aegis is a trust-minimized execution environment for Solana that enables a new generation of private, autonomous AI agents. [cite_start]It solves the critical on-chain problems of **MEV**, **alpha leakage**, and the **private data barrier** by separating confidential off-chain computation from on-chain settlement[cite: 12]. By leveraging a Zero-Knowledge Virtual Machine (zkVM), Aegis allows agents to operate on sensitive data and execute proprietary logic without ever exposing it on a public ledger.
